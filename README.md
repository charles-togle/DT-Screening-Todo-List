# DT Screening-Todo List
 


**How did you tackle the task?**

- Creating this kind of to do list is not new to me so logic wise I already know what to do
- I used CSS to add a strikethrough effect for those tasks that are done
- I used the document.createElement function of javascript to append all the dynamically created elements
- I used GitHub Copilot intergrated to my VSCode to search for syntax that I have forgot.

**What have I learned**

- In the past I have only used prompts to take user input for this kind of project but in this project I levelled it up and I used modals and promises so that it acted like the prompt() function of javascript but with better UI

**Did you finish in less than 2 hours?**

- I finished this project within a total of 1 hour 30 mins.
- started with no design in mind and used only black and white colors for simplicity

**How to use it?**

- There is a pre loaded sample to do list group that you can test to mark and delete
- To create a to do list group click the "+" button at the corner right of the screen and input a heading for that group
- To create a task, just click the "+" button on the corner right of the to do list group, and input the task to the modal
- To remove a task just click ‚ùå right beside it
- To mark a task done, just click the checkbox right next to the said task
